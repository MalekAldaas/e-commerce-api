### ðŸ§ª Importing Tests

The `insomnia-tests/little-lemon-api-tests.insomnia.yaml` file contains all saved requests and test cases.

To import:

1. Open Insomnia.  
2. Click on the **Insomnia icon** â†’ **Import**.  
3. Choose **"From File"**.  
4. Select `insomnia-tests/little-lemon-api-tests.insomnia.yaml`.

### ðŸ”‘ Setting Up Environment Variables

You can find **"Generating Access Token"** folder containing requests to generate access tokens.

You need to use these requests to obtain access tokens and then replace the corresponding environment variables with the generated tokens for the API requests to work properly.

> **Note:** This ensures the requests use valid authentication tokens stored in environment variables like `{{customer_token}}`.
